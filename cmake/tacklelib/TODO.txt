SetVarsFromFiles.cmake:

* tests!
* support a list variable expansion including expansion in a list value.

testlib:

* implement search for a test case function/macro directly in an inclusion file
  before include it to filter out test cases by a test case filter before
  run a cmake process with inclusion file.
  Leave the `tkl_testmodule_run_test_cases` function as an optional to
  explicitly declare test case list to enable/disable tests.

File.cmake

* remove `file` function override present as a workaround (may be not required
  anymore) to remove x16 slowdown.
