2020.07.07:
* fixed: the `wtee.exe` utility (is removed) has an issue over a console progress bar (`\r` (character return) is not handled properly and so the output is messed), the gnuwin32 tee utility has another issue over `Cwrite error: No such file or directroy` error message when the pipe/output handle does close by the system. To workaround those issues the UnxUtils tee utility implementation does used instead of these are because works as expected in both cases.
