#!/bin/bash

# Description:
#   Script to update (add or replace) a file from all commits in a repository
#   using `git filter-branch` command.
#

# Usage:
#   git_filter_branch_update_file.sh [<flags>] [//] <abs-path-to-file> <sourcetree-path-to-dir> [<cmd-line>]
#
#   <flags>:
#     -f
#       Use `cp -f` instead.
#   //:
#     Separator to stop parse flags.
#   <abs-path-to-file>:
#     Absolute local file path to copy from.
#   <sourcetree-path-to-dir>:
#     Source tree relative file path of a directory to copy to.
#   <cmd-line>:
#     The rest of command line passed to `git filter-branch` command.

# CAUTION:
#   Path `<abs-path-to-file>` must be outside of the working copy, otherwise
#   the Git will complain about unstaged changes:
#   `Cannot rewrite branches: You have unstaged changes.`
#   This happens because in that case the `<abs-path-to-file>` is changed or
#   a new file.
#
#   DO NOT USE relative path as long as `git filter-branch` operates on
#   internal current directory.

# Examples:
#   # To update all commits in all heads to update first commit(s) in all
#   # ancestor branches.
#   >
#   cd myrepo/path
#   git_filter_branch_update_file.sh <absolute-path>/changelog.txt . -- --all
#
#   # To update all commits by tag `t1` to update first commit(s) in all
#   # ancestor branches.
#   >
#   cd myrepo/path
#   git_filter_branch_update_file.sh <absolute-path>/changelog.txt . -- t1
#
#   # To update single commit by a tag.
#   >
#   cd myrepo/path
#   git_filter_branch_update_file.sh <absolute-path>/changelog.txt . -- t1 --not t1^@
#
#   >
#   cd myrepo/path
#   git_filter_branch_update_file.sh <absolute-path>/changelog.txt . -- t1^!

# CAUTION:
#   In a generic case the `rev-list` parameter of the `git filter-branch`
#   command must be a set of commit ranges to rewrite a single commit or a set
#   of commits. This is required because a commit in the commits tree can has
#   multiple parent commits and to select a single commit with multiple parents
#   (merge commit) you must issue a range of commits for EACH PARENT to define
#   range in each parent branch.
#
#   In other words a single expression `<obj>~1..<ref>` does not guarantee a
#   selection of a single commit if `<ref>` points a commit with multiple
#   parents or has it on a way over other commits to the `<obj>`.
#   The same for the `<ref> --not <obj>^@` or `<obj>^@..<ref>` expression if
#   the path between `<ref>` and `<obj>` contains more than 1 commit. In that
#   particular case to select a single commit you must use multiple ranges.
#
#   If `<ref>` and `<obj>` points the same commit (range for a single), then
#   the `<ref> --not <obj>^@` or `<obj>^@..<ref>` or `<ref>^!` is enough to
#   always select a single commit in any tree.

# CAUTION:
#   If a file already exist in a being updated commit or in a commit
#   child/children and has changes, then the script does replace an existing
#   file including children commits changes. This means that the changes in
#   all child branches would be lost.

#
#   If you are trying to replace a file and it has changes in next child
#   commit(s), for example, `changelog.txt` file, then you must rewrite it in
#   each next child, otherwise the next commits will be left with old file.
#   In that case actual to use `git_filter_branch_update_file_text.sh` with
#   file text search and replace instead of a file add/replace or manually
#   rewrite each next child commit before call to `git replace --graft ...`.

# NOTE:
#   You must use `git_filter_branch_cleanup.sh` script to cleanup the
#   repository from intermediate references.
