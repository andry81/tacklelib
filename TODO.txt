1. Extract additionally to the template file line version (some kind of
   shebang line with a version for the file) the body hash (with out version
   line) and compare it with the same values from the instance file and from
   the cache (implement it too).

   Here is the table of states and the actions associated with each state.

   The template and the instance file has 2 parameters:
   * version
   * body hash (excluding the version line)

   The cache contains both parameters for both files (4 parameters) together
   or none of them.

             |             |            | 3. Write the template and the

             |             |            | 3. Write the template and the

             |             |            | 2. If the template version is
             |             |            |    greater than in the cache and
             |             |            |    body hash is not different,
             |             |            |    then throw an error because the
             |             |            |    template version is the only
             |             |            |    component which was changed
             |             |            |    after a checkout.
             |             |            | 3. If the template version is not
             |             |            |    different and body hash is
             |             |            |    different, then throw an error
             |             |            |    because either has been forgotten
             |             |            |    to increment the template version
             |             |            |    before the last commit or is

             |             |            |    the next commit.

Legend:
  `any`         - Does not matter the state, the file or a value can exist
                  or not.
  `existed`     - Does not matter the state but the file or a value is
                  present.
  `absent`      - The file or a value does not exist.
  `unchanged`   - The file or a value or values is unchanged versus the same
                  component or components to a left column item.
                  If not specified which one component, then addresses the
                  entire item or all items.
  `changed`     - The file or a value or values is changed versus the same
                  component or components to a left column item.
                  If not specified which one component, then addresses the
                  entire item or all items.
